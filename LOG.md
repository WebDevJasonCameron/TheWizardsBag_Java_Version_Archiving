# Log

## 2024 08 21
I started this project earlier this year.  I got really far, but (as with everything) I got side track with so many other things.  I was learning so much with this project and I want to come back to it.  I really think it was organized pretty well.  However, I can't remember what I was getting stuck on.  That is why I should have had a log.  Even though it's a little late in the game, I figured I would create a log now.  I think I can figure out where I left off.  I'll put my thoughts on the subject here.  At least I had a plan written in the RM.
