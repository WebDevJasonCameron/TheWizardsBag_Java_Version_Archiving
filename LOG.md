Alright.  I have a python tool that needs to be built for work.  After that is done, I'll come back to this.  Should take about a week.  Fingers crossed!

Good progress in today's reintegration of the code.  I am still not sure how to go about handling all the CLI menus.  However, I was able to get back to the basics of input and response within the CLI.  It is good to finally get back into the simple stuff.  I hope I will look back at all this and think that I am being too simple as I will have grown to grasp the more complex modular stuff.  I am not even using Java beyond its most basic capes.  Still, got to start (or keep restarting) somewhere.

I was trying to figure out where to start back into.  I think I was first working on trying to create a GUI system with JavaFX.  The problem, I hadn't figured out the interaction that needs to be done.  That means, I want to run through the CLI menu commands.  I want to figure out how the User should interact with the DB.  That leaves me to wonder (once again) where to begin.  Since the DB is created and the CRUD commands are already created, lets write a simple menu (test menu) that ask the User to input a "spell name" to search for.  If the name returns a response, we can display it and ask if the user wants to search again or finish the program.  If it doesn't, it should tell the user that nothing was found and (once again), ask them if they want to try again or finish the program.  Really simple I know.  That's what happens when you don't get to write code all day... instead, I'm spending my time at work as a "sys-ad," something I can do but really don't want to do.  I digress... this is where we are for tonight's work.

I started this project earlier this year.  I got really far, but (as with everything) I got side track with so many other things.  I was learning so much with this project and I want to come back to it.  I really think it was organized pretty well.  However, I can't remember what I was getting stuck on.  That is why I should have had a log.  Even though it's a little late in the game, I figured I would create a log now.  I think I can figure out where I left off.  I'll put my thoughts on the subject here.  At least I had a plan written in the RM.

I think I was working on the Java GUI by looking up all the JavaFX tutorials.
