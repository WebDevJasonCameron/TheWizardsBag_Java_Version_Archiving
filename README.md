# TheWizardsBag

## Welcome
Hello.  Are you peaking into the mysteries of the Wizard's bag?  Welcome!  Unlike some of my mage friends, I love to share what magical incantations I've discovered over the years.  Here, at The Wizard's Bag LLC, we strive to provide a great web store experience!  After all, you might be able to duplicate our store, You can never duplicate our products, service, and winning *charisma (level 20, with the right gear!).  

## Purpose
Aright then, with introductions aside, the purpose of this project is to build Table-Top Fantasy Role Plying Game (TTFRPG) Web Store that sales all types of items.  Everything form magical to mundane will be offered withing the Web Store.  Eventually, users will be able to search, note, comment and like what is being sold.  Although, much more are planned for the final product, I will need to stay small on the initial build.  

## Road Ahead **10,000 Mile High View**
