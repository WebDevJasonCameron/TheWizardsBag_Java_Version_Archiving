# Key

## Purpose
I found that I like to write specific key tags when I write comments.  You will see what I write a LOT of comments.  This is often because I use most of my repos as sandboxes for idea projects.  As such, I am trying to figure out a lot as I build.  Sometimes that causes me to write down why I did something the way I did.  This key provides an understanding to things I deemed worthy of going back to... and why.
