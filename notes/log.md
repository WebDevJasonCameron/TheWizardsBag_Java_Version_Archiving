## 2022-11-24 | About the Start
I started this project a week ago.  I started with a db design.  That has changed as I construct the sql and java classes.  I'm trying to think things out without going too deep. I may want the scope to grow later. However, nothing is going to get done if the scope is too large.  As such, I am focusing on building out a library of D&D items that can be searched through with specific attributes.  I'll include a list of spells that are most likely attached to the magical items.  Later we will use users to log in and write notes on specific items.  Much later, I'd like to remember what the user searched for, what they liked or disliked and how much the wrote about a specific item.  We could use this to help promote items they might want later!  Finally, the items in this library will be presented to users within a web-store called "The Wizards Bag."  Yup, this will be yet another online store.  Fun!!

### 1300 | Spell list
I found that some awesome people have already created a spell list in csv, json, or text.  Here are the websites I'll probably use to help load my database:
- [tadzik GitHub](https://github.com/tadzik/5e-spells/blob/master/spells.json)
- [vopalhex GitHub *Best*](https://github.com/vorpalhex/srd_spells/blob/master/spells.json)

Also, Here are some sites for items:
- [prices can be found here](https://dungeonmastertools.github.io/items.html)

Here are some with everything:
- [BTMorton](https://github.com/BTMorton/dnd-5e-srd/blob/master/json/04%20equipment.json)
